### Introduction
This project is a review of fundamental concepts in game theory and includes simulations of typical games and an elaboration on the Nash Equilibrium. The project is divided into two parts, Overleaf and Google Colab.<br>
This project have two parts, the first part is the overleaf project, and the second part is colab part. Aiming to review basic concepts in game theory, the two parts helped us review the definitions and the simulation taught us the basic analysis ability of result of simulations.
### Code
#### Overleaf project:
[Overleaf](https://github.com/Rising-Stars-by-Sunshine/CS-ECON206_Yiwei_Liang_PS2/blob/62e5a230e61bc75f3cbb773537f4daa02539daa4/code/CSECON206_ProblemSet2_Spring2023-Yiwei.zip)<br>
For the overleaf project, it concluds reflections on Game Theory,  Bayesian Nash Equilibrium: Definition, Theorem, and Proof, and Game Theory Glossar Table. In this project, my Latex skills is strengthened and improved.
#### Colab project:
[Colab](https://github.com/Rising-Stars-by-Sunshine/CS-ECON206_Yiwei_Liang_PS2/blob/8e404371a3078e7e7f81886e25504b1c00f55f37/code/PS2.ipynb)<br>
For the colab project, it concludes two games, first one is normal form matrix game, and the second one is extensive form game. This two game simulation taught me basic ability of how to analysis and implement the tools for game theory.

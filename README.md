### Introduction
This project is a review of fundamental concepts in game theory and includes simulations of typical games and an elaboration on the Nash Equilibrium. The project is divided into two parts, Overleaf and Google Colab.<br>
This project have two parts, the first part is the overleaf project, and the second part is colab part. Aiming to review basic concepts in game theory, the two parts helped us review the definitions and the simulation taught us the basic analysis ability of result of simulations.
### Code
#### Overleaf project:
[Overleaf](https://github.com/Rising-Stars-by-Sunshine/CS-ECON206_Yiwei_Liang_PS2/blob/main/code/CSECON206_ProblemSet2_Spring2023-Yiwei_updated.zip)<br>
For the overleaf project, it concluds reflections on Game Theory,  Bayesian Nash Equilibrium: Definition, Theorem, and Proof, and Game Theory Glossar Table. In this project, my Latex skills is strengthened and improved.
#### Colab project:
[Colab](https://github.com/Rising-Stars-by-Sunshine/CS-ECON206_Yiwei_Liang_PS2/blob/8e404371a3078e7e7f81886e25504b1c00f55f37/code/PS2.ipynb)<br>
For the colab project, it concludes two games, first one is normal form matrix game, and the second one is extensive form game. This two game simulation taught me basic ability of how to analysis and implement the tools for game theory.
### Spotlight
#### Overleaf project 
The Overleaf project is titled "A General Introduction to Game Theory: An Interdisciplinary Approach." The project is divided into four parts.

- Part I is the self-introduction of the author, which is not specified in the provided structure.

- Part II of the project provides a brief history of the development of game theory.

- Part III of the project is focused on Bayesian Nash Equilibrium. It provides a definition of Bayesian Nash Equilibrium, along with a theorem and proof.

- Part IV of the project consists of Game Theory Glossary Tables. It provides a list of terms used in game theory, along with their definitions.
#### Colab project
- The Stag Hunt Game is a normal form matrix game in which two players have to choose between hunting a hare or a stag. Hunting a hare always yields a payoff of h>0, while hunting a stag yields a higher payoff of s>h, but requires a coordinated effort from both players. The game has three Nash equilibria, one of which is a pure strategy equilibrium where both players hunt the stag, and two mixed strategy equilibria where each player randomizes between hunting the stag and hunting the hare.

- The Ultimatum Game is an extensive form game played by two players: the proposer and the responder. In this game, the proposer suggests how to split a sum of money between themselves and the responder. If the responder agrees, the money is split as suggested, but if they decline, neither player gets any money. The game has four extreme equilibria, two of which are pure strategy equilibria, and two of which are mixed strategy equilibria. In the pure strategy equilibria, player 1 chooses strategy 1, and player 2 chooses either strategy 1 or strategy 2, resulting in both players receiving an expected payoff of 3. In the mixed strategy equilibria, both players use mixed strategies, resulting in different expected payoffs for both players.

Yiwei Liang is a sophomore student majored in Computation and Design with tracks in Computer Science at DKU. Yiwei is interested in Ai-painting and voice clone project, has few experience of applying vits and so-vits projects.
- Final reflections <br>
After completing this project, I have experienced significant intellectual and professional growth in the field of game theory. I have gained a deeper understanding of the fundamental concepts in game theory, such as Nash Equilibrium, Bayesian Nash Equilibrium, normal form matrix games, and extensive form games. The simulations in the Colab project allowed me to apply these concepts in a practical setting, and I have learned how to analyze and interpret the results of these simulations. The Overleaf project has also strengthened my Latex skills, allowing me to communicate my ideas and findings more effectively.
